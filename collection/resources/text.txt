I like holidays.
They are funny.
The holidays are New Year, Womenâ€™s Day, Victory Day, Christmas, Easter, Independence Day.
These holidays are important for people. Birthday is my favourite holiday. I get a lot of presents on my birthday.
I always invite my friends for my birthday.
We have much fun.
